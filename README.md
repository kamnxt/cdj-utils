_Utility scripts for making life with CDJs less painful_

## uwu what's this?
this is a couple scripts for converting an audio library into MP3s that play nicely on CDJ2000s.\
CDJ2000s are a bit finicky sometimes, and seem to work best with LAME encoded MP3s.\
`convert_file.sh` should convert most files that ffmpeg understands into MP3s that work fine - 48k 16bit, with max 800x800 thumbnails (keeping the aspect ratio!)
